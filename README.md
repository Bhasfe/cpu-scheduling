## Mobile CPU Scheduling Simulator<br>

### Description<br>

This application has been developed to simulate the *CPU scheduling algorithms* on a *Gantt Chart* by using **React Native (Expo CLI)**.

**The Algorithms**: 

* First Come First Serve (Non Preemptive)<br>
* Shortest Job First (Non Preemptive)<br>
* Shortest Remaining Time First (Preemptive)<br>
* Round Robin (Preemptive)<br>

### Requirements<br>
[Node 12 LTS](https://nodejs.org/) or greater must be installed 
This application has been developed by using Expo CLI<br>
You can use npm to install Expo CLI by using following command<br>
`npm install -g expo-cli`<br>
or<br>
`yarn global add expo-cli`<br>
The dependancies must be installed, go to the project directory in terminal and run<br>
`npm install`<br>
 
### TODO's<br>
* Optimization issues will solve
* I/O device simulations will be added
* Priorty Scheduling will be included
* Multilevel Queue Scheduling will be included
